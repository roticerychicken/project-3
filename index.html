  <h1>About </h1>
 
  <section id="about">
  <p>
    To understand the self and ones abilities is a lifelong journey. I, Jonah Patinkin, have a passion for engineering and computer programming. It began as a child where i drew random objects for pleasure in hopes to discover how they work and how they were built. Growing up in the Chicago Suburbs of Skokie and Evanston illinois, I attended Evanston Township Highschool where i attended ever computer science related class they had to offer and started a drone building club known as flight club. Afterwards I went on to pursue a computer science degree at Illinois Institute of Technology.
